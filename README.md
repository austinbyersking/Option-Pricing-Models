# Option-Pricing-Models
==================================


This is a collection of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) based on different topics in the area of quantitative finance.

The aim of these notebooks is to present these interesting topics, by showing their practical application through an interactive python implementation.

These topics require a basic knowledge in stochastic calculus, financial mathematics and statistics. A basic knowledge of python programming is also necessary.

Every notebook is (almost) independent from the others. Therefore you can select only the notebook you are interested in!

I think that beginners to intermediates in quantitative finance will find these notebooks very useful!  

These notes are for students in science, economics or finance who have followed at least one undergraduate course in financial mathematics and statistics.       
Self-taught students or practicioners should have read at least an introductiory book on financial mathematics.




### Is this series of notebooks complete?

**No!**    
I will upload more notebooks from time to time. 

At the moment, I'm interested in the areas of stochastic processes, Kalman Filter, statistics and much more. I will add more interesting notebooks on these topics in the future. 

If you have any kind of questions, or if you find some errors, or you have suggestions for improvements, feel free to contact me.
